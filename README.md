## Deployment instruction
See `partial-nginx.conf` for the configuration file  
## Build instructions
You need npm (Node Package Manager) and `gulp`  
To install gulp, using npm, do the following: `npm install -g gulp`.  

To install the project dependencies `npm install`, to build the project do `gulp`, a new folder named `dist` will be created, with the website's files.

The website is now available at `thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/dist/` (where `thebestmotherfuckingwebsite` is the folder created when you `git clone`d the project).  

Enjoy!
